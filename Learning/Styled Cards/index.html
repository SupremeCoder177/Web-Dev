                Look at this image of a foggy forest, doesn't it make you want
                to spend your morning here with a cup of coffee, I know I do.
                Let's make sure out future generations can do it too.

                Ah the glorious mountains, such a sight to behold,
                look at those jagged peaks and slopes, how incredible must it be
                to be able to climb such beautiful structures and gaze down.

                Or maybe look to the heavans above and wonder how much more is to go.
